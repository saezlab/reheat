### About

ReHeaT is a user friendly portal to explore, analyze and download the
transcriptional consensus signature of human end-stage heart failure
(HF-CS).

The HF-CS is based on a
[meta-analysis](https://github.com/saezlab/HF_meta-analysis) of 16
independent studies.

### How to access

You can access a live version running
[here](https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/reheat/) on the server from
`shinyapps.io`.

Alternatively you can also run the app locally in an interactive R
session:

``` r
shiny::runGitHub("reheat", "saezlab")
```
